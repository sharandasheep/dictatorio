		<h2>Chapter Two: Dictator Rap Song</h2>
		<h3 id="text-style">Lyrics</h3>
		<p id="text-style">We rely on a dictator to pull us out of poverty
It starts from peoples’ undenyable oddity
When a dictator seizes power
Then the the people cannot flower

If a country is in depression
A dictator can make an impression
But they need a specific environment
The economy should be in retirement
The government should be unstable
And their military as small as a table

Their territory should be puny
And the leaders are all unruly
The country is in an unknowing bubble
And nationalism is high after being crushed to rubble

We rely on a dictator to pull us out of poverty
It starts from peoples’ undenyable oddity
When a dictator seizes power
Then the the people cannot flower

An example of a well-known tyrant
Is Adolf Hitler among them all
Who soon enough led the country to fall
They all believed to go against the Jews
Rather than making peace and trying to enthuse
Unlike Adolf Hitler, Stalin killed handfuls of his people
After the rise of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin included a sequel

He promised bread, peace, and to take others’ land
But he never ended up lending as much as a hand
He made this agreement with the dictator Hitler
But he did not know that it would soon turn to litter
He got several warnings that Hitler was gonna turn
And he decided to let Hitler leave the agreement to burn

We rely on a dictator to pull us out of poverty
It starts from peoples’ undenyable oddity
When a dictator seizes power
Then the the people cannot flower

He thought that Hitler could help the society turn into something
But it really just left the economy with nothing 
Hitler turned his back on the ignorant Stalin
So the Soviets economy is just fallin’

Totalitarianism is the ideal place
Where a dictator can easily take their space
The tyrant makes decisions and no one can question
A civilian will be punished if they show any aggression
The leader always gets the final vote
They are worshipped as the most powerful, with the ability to smote

We rely on a dictator to pull us out of poverty
It starts from peoples’ undenyable oddity
When a dictator seizes power
Then the the people cannot flower

Fascism, forcing your power
Strip the people of their rights and make them cower
There still are people with the feeling of doubt
That the leader might lead them to famine and drought 

Fascists want no democracy
The dictator is the highest class, they’re the aristocracy
They care about the society more than the people
