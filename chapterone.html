	<h2>Chapter One: What Makes A Good Dictator</h2>
	<h3 id="text-style"><b>Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany</b></h3>
	<p id="text-style">Adolf Hitler was one of the most influential leaders in all of history, up there with Napoleon, Lincoln, and many other leaders that did great things, even if those things were terrible.</p>
	<p id="text-style">Hitler was born in Austria and was raised by a mother he loved and a father he hated. In Hitler’s childhood, his father was a civil servant and died in 1903. Hitler dropped out of secondary school and wanted to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. He was rejected from Vienna’s fine arts academy. After his mother died in 1908, he moved to Vienna and started selling images. He read a lot of politics and this led to ideas of Nazi. Hitler had some service in Munich in WW1. One notable thing was that he earned a medal called the Iron Cross for his bravery in WWI and he wore it until he died. This shows how much he values this bravery and being the best. After Hitler returned to Munich in 1918, he joined the small German Worker’s party. This was a strong German nationalist group. He was skilled in speech and propaganda and was very persuading. Hitler used the swastika symbol of peace that would later be a representation of terror and and power. Hitler led the growing Nazi party which punished the terms of the Versailles Treaty. He recruited Ernest Rohm who got the strong arm squads (Sturmabteilung-SA). On November 8, 1923, members of the SA marched into a beer hall. Led by Hitler, they proclaimed the beginning of a national revolution. They got into a gun fight with the police and fled, but were later captured and sent to jail. Hitler was obsessed with ethnic purity. He placed the Aryan Race on top. He also established the Hitler youth for kids to also join and the Schutzstaffel (SS), a better alternative to SA. In 1932, Hitler ran against Hindenburg for president and was declared chancellor. The government passed a law that the Nazi Party constitutes as the only political party in Germany. When Hindenburg died, Hitler was declared commander of all armed forces. His power continued to grow, and his officer Goebbels of the Propaganda Department helped him win the hearts of the people. In his time as dictator, he made the Holocaust and started WWII, invading some of the strongest countries at the time, such as Poland and France.</p>

	<h3 id="text-style"><b>Joseph Stalin of Soviet Russia</b></h3>
	<p id="text-style">While Hitler got all the attention for starting WWII and the Holocaust and also for his master race, Stalin was the most evil dictator of them all. Killing not just people of other counries that were enemies during the war but also setting up concentration camps called the Gulag system that killed his own people.</p>
	<p id="text-style">In his childhood, Stalin was bullied and never taken seriously, so he grew with a quest for vengeance to earn power. He was born in modern-day Georgia which at the time was a part of Russia. He was exiled to Siberia once for organizing a labor strike. He gained power and became general secretary of the Communist Party. He assisted Vladimir Lenin in fleeing to Finland in the revolution, with the help of Travski. When Lenin died, Stalin seized control of Russia and did many things. He signed a pact with Hitler and Nazi Germany which would end up being broken, forcing Russia into WWII. He killed many of his own people in the attempt to boost the industrial state. He took over the peasant farms and made them state-control, starting a famine in Russia. Overall, Stalin did many things.</p>

	<h3 id="text-style"><b>Hideki Tojo of Japanese Empire</b></h3>
	<p id="text-style">Hideki Tojo was not the emperor of Japan. The emperor, Hirohito, was not the one who encouraged war on the United States, or the alliance with Germany and Italy to start WWII. It was Hideki Tojo, infamous military leader that served in the Japanese army longer than most. He recieved many medals for his participation in the army.</p>
	<p id="text-style">Tojo hated the British and especially the Americans. The Japanese were not all too powerful just yet, but Hideki Tojo changed that by proceeding to declare war and successfully invade all of China. Japan, now one of the largest empires in Asia except for Russia, bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in 1941. This caused America to join the war in the Pacific as well. Tojo's regime would end when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed and Japan surrendered. Hirohito had his control over Japan returned.</p>

	<h3 id="text-style"><b>Benito Mussolini of Fascist Italy</b></h3>
	<p id="text-style">Mussolini was usually known as Hitler's 'sidekick' during the war, though he played a bigger role in Hitler's rise to power and in the war itself. Hitler himself considered the ideology of Fascist Italy 'the elder brother of Nazi Germany.' After all, Mussolini was the inventor of Fascism.</p>
	<p id="text-style">Mussolini began his quest to dictatorship with a march on Rome. There, he was elected Prime Minister of Italy, which quickly esclated into dictator. In the League of Nations, Italy insisted on invading Abyssinia, also known as modern-day Ethiopia. While other countries said no to the idea, Hitler and Nazi Germany supported Italy throughout the invasion. Fascist Italy finally fell in WWII during Operation Avalanche, when Americans, Britishmen, and Canadians stormed Italy, replacing the government with one that immediately surrendered. Mussolini tried to flee to peaceful Switzerland, but was killed by people he worked with. Soldiers of Victor Emmanuel, who Mussolini appointed as King of Albania and Emperor of Ethiopia, executed Benito Mussolini.</p>

	<h3 id="text-style"><b>What It Takes to Be a Dictator</b></h3>
	<p id="text-style">Every dictator should possess the qualities of calm, confident, and strict because they need to be brave in tough situations, they need to stay strong and not be swayed, and finally they need to get their point across and show their power through their speech and actions. If a person is hungry for power then they will most likely be a dictator because of their supporters and confidence. A dictator should always be calm because when things go wrong in your plans for world domination, you have to be able to think straight and make the right choices to fight back for control. It will also help convince the people you rule over that you are a good leader and that you know how to invade someone else properly. Confidence is something that every dictator requires in order to make your citizens believe that you make their country the biggest world power. You have to be confident in front of your minions so none of them tries to overthrow you and take your place. You also have to be confident in your armies that they can keep taking other countries, but you also have to keep growing. If you hesitate too much, your people won’t think you are ready to take down even the biggest and baddest countries. In order to be a good dictator you need to be power hungry. If you do not have a thirst for power than you will not be able continue demolishing other countries. You cannot back down. You need to push and not lose the thirst to gain world power. A good dictator should have a convincing voice. When performing speeches in front of your citizens and persuading them to join the war effort, you have to sound strong and confident. You have to make them believe that you are smart enough to take over your whole continent, and that you have created a plan to do it. Your voice also needs to be reassuring, so the people think that you will keep them safe from the outside. This trait is key to seizing control over your country and leading them to world domination! You need to be able to persuade other countries to bow down to you. If you want to be a dictator and say, “I am a good person, I should be dictator!” then you will not get the power because people will not like you and trust you. You need good reasoning and you need to convince the countries on why you will help and not hurt them.</p>
