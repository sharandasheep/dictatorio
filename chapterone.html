		<h2>Chapter One: What Makes A Good Dictator</h2>
		<h3 id="text-style"><b>Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany</b></h3>
		<p id="text-style">Adolf Hitler was one of the most influential leaders in all of history, up there with Napoleon, Lincoln, and many other leaders that did great things, even if those things were terrible.</p>
		<p id="text-style">Hitler was born in Austria and was raised by a mother he loved and a father he hated. In Hitler’s childhood, his father was a civil servant and died in 1903. Hitler dropped out of secondary school and wanted to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. He was rejected from Vienna’s fine arts academy. After his mother died in 1908, he moved to Vienna and started selling images. He read a lot of politics and this led to ideas of Nazi. Hitler had some service in Munich in WW1. One notable thing was that he earned a medal called the Iron Cross for his bravery in WWI and he wore it until he died. This shows how much he values this bravery and being the best. After Hitler returned to Munich in 1918, he joined the small German Worker’s party. This was a strong German nationalist group. He was skilled in speech and propaganda and was very persuading. Hitler used the swastika symbol of peace that would later be a representation of terror and and power. Hitler led the growing Nazi party which punished the terms of the Versailles Treaty. He recruited Ernest Rohm who got the strong arm squads (Sturmabteilung-SA). On November 8, 1923, members of the SA marched into a beer hall. Led by Hitler, they proclaimed the beginning of a national revolution. They got into a gun fight with the police and fled, but were later captured and sent to jail. Hitler was obsessed with ethnic purity. He placed the Aryan Race on top. He also established the Hitler youth for kids to also join and the Schutzstaffel (SS), a better alternative to SA. In 1932, Hitler ran against Hindenburg for president and was declared chancellor. The government passed a law that the Nazi Party constitutes as the only political party in Germany. When Hindenburg died, Hitler was declared commander of all armed forces. His power continued to grow, and his officer Goebbels of the Propaganda Department helped him win the hearts of the people. In his time as dictator, he made the Holocaust and started WWII, invading some of the strongest countries at the time, such as Poland and France.</p>
