		<h2>Chapter Four: Why People Will Follow Dictators</h2>
		<br></br>
		<h3 id="text-style">Why do people follow Dictators?</h3>
		<p id="text-style">People follow dictators for many different reasons including fear, belief, and persuasion. Many dictators inspire fear and punish people for not following them. If someone defies the orders, they must face the consequences. People also follow dictators because they agree with the beliefs of  the tyrant. Also, the dictator might be very persuading.</p>
		<h3 id="text-style">Would you follow A Dictator, and Why?</h3>
		<p id="text-style">I would follow a dictator depending on their beliefs, because if they want to take the area that they are leading to a path of something I approve of, I might follow them. Also, I might follow them if I fear them, and if they threaten me.</p>
		<h3 id="text-style">What if they asked you to hurt someone else?</h3>
		<p id="text-style">I probably would not hurt them, but you never know with a dictator that could brainwash the citizens.</p>

		<p id="text-style">Your brain has a mind of its own. While you think you will do one thing, you end up doing the opposite. The experiment of Stanley Milgram proves that is psychologically possible for anyone to follow a dictator for many different possible reasons. Milgram’s experiment tested why people would follow dictators, and how dictators convinced them to kill. A reason could be fear. Many people fear the consequences against fighting the powerful person and fear that they might lose their life, or their family’s. The people in Stanley Milgram’s experiment seemed scared of the proctor that strictly refused to let them stop. People also follow dictators because of belief. Hitler believed in killing the Jews, and many followed because they approved of doing so. Finally, people would do it to fit in. If everyone else does it, they might do it too. In some of the other experiments of Milgram, people in an elevator were actors and they would turn to face the back of the elevators at all times. People would come in, and because of seeming peer pressure, they would turn around too. Everyone, even if they think that they will never permit one, can follow a dictator, whether they know it or not. Dictators are so powerful, if they order you to kill, you might actually kill. In Milgram’s experiment, almost everyone followed the orders with little questioning. It proved that while most Americans thought that dictators always took control by force, many people believed in the dictators. A dictator can take over any country as long as he or she is convincing and fear-inspiring.</p>
