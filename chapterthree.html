	<br></br>
	<p id="text-style">Nazi Propaganda was effective because of it made a leader to the public, it rallied the nation, it gave the people an enemy, it paved a way for the next generation, it wrote the news, lied to the public, and assessed guilt. First, it painted a picture of Hitler to the public as an intelligent leader that would bring Germany back to what it used to be. "How many look up to him [Hitler] with touching faith as their helper, their savior, their deliverer from unbearable distress." Next, it rallied the nation. Nationalism was already high after WWI, and Germany just needed someone to lead them. It also gave Germany several enemies to blame for their problems. Examples are communists, Jews, French, and British. It also gave the next generation a new purpose. "These boys and girls enter our organizations [at] ten years of age, and often for the first time get a little fresh air; after four years of the Young Folk they go on to the Hitler Youth, where we have them for another four years.‚Äù Next, it wrote the news for Germany. Political signs that humiliated the Jews and insulted the communists were displayed all around cities. Next, it lied to the public. That was what Joseph Goebbels and Nazi propaganda was all about: Brainwashing the Germans to follow Hitler and his Master Race. Finally, it assessed guilt. "Nazism," as German Jewish writer Victor Klemperer wrote in 1946, had "permeated the flesh and blood of the people through single words, idioms, and sentence structures which were imposed on them in a million repetitions and taken on board mechanically and unconsciously." Overall, Nazi propaganda had many components that were put into it for it to function.</p>
